Welcome to the `Efficient Computing Lab.`
We focus on energy efficiency, system optimization, user experience, and sustainable tech solutions. 
Our research interests are the followings:  

• Model Compression: Enhancing machine learning models’ efficiency through techniques like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation for better performance in resource-limited settings.   
• AI Compiler: Developing optimized AI compilers to reduce computational power, energy use, and execution time, improving efficiency and sustainability.   

For detailed research areas and insights into graduate life, please refer to the following slides.
Students interested in pursuing graduate studies are encouraged to contact me directly after following the application instructions provided in the slides.
