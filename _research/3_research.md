Deep Learning Compiler
The NEST Compiler (NEST-C) is an open source project led by ETRI, which is based on [GLOW project] (https://github.com/pytorch/glow). Glow is a machine learning compiler and execution engine for hardware accelerators. It is designed to be used as a backend for high-level machine learning frameworks. The compiler is designed to allow state of the art compiler optimizations and code generation of neural network graphs. The objective of NEST-C is to generate optimized code for various kinds of Neural-network Processing Uints (NPUs). Therefore, NEST-C provides automatic tuning functionalities and tools for each optimization step.
