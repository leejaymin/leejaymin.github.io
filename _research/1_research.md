- Total Grant: ~ 10,000,000 dollar

The purpose of this project is to develop an open SW and HW platform for edge AI SoC development over the next 5 years.
Specifically, we developed a DL compiler for NPUs using MLIR. The compiler aims to develop a Dialect IR that can accommodate high-level model lightweight and effectively express the characteristics of NPUs.
